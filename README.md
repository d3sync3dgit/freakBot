A multipurpose discord bot mainly focused towards private servers

Including:
* Moderate support for admin commands
* Fully working database for registering users

How to configure:
* Replace bottom line of signing in with bot with your token
* Replace all empty fields, IDs and role applications to your own needs as they will error otherwise

This was a quick rush job on uploading to github sooo figure everything else out yourself
